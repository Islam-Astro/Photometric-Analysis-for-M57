# Photometric Study of M57 (NGC 6720) Using KFISP

## Overview
This repository presents the photometric analysis of the planetary nebula **M57 (NGC 6720)** using data obtained from the **1.88-m Kottamia Astronomical Observatory (KAO)** with the **Kottamia Faint Imaging Spectro-Polarimeter (KFISP)**. The study focuses on the **central star’s brightness** and the **nebular structure** in multiple bands.

## Telescope and Instrumentation
Observations were carried out using the **1.88-m KAO telescope** equipped with a **KFISP CCD camera**. The main specifications are as follows:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Telescope** | 1.88-m KAO |
| **CCD Model** | E2V 42-40 2K CCD |
| **Pixel Scale** | 0.24 arcsec/pixel |
| **Field of View** | 8.2 × 8.2 arcmin² |
| **Filters** | UBVRI + SDSS-ugriz |

## Data Reduction & Analysis
The data were reduced following standard photometric procedures:  
**Bias and Flat-field correction → Cosmic Ray Removal → Astrometric Calibration → Aperture Photometry**  

### Example of a V-band Frame Before & After Reduction  
Raw and reduced **V filter frames** of M57 are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the data reduction pipeline.  

**Figure 1**: (a) Raw V filter frame of M57 before data reduction. (b) Same frame after reduction and cosmic ray removal.

### M57 Frame in Detector Coordinates  
The reduced **V-band frame** is displayed in two representations:

## Photometry of M57's Central Star
The brightness measurements for M57’s central star in different filters are provided below:

| Date | Filter | Magnitude (m ± σ) |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| 20 April 2024 (JD 2460420.5) | B | 13.38 ± 0.01 |
|  | V | 13.94 ± 0.02 |
|  | R | 14.67 ± 0.02 |
|  | I | 15.12 ± 0.02 |

### Photometric Calibration  
The **target star (central star)** and **comparison stars** used for photometric calibration are marked.
